Today, we  learned how to solve problems for "Fast Functions".   we made functions to simplify other functions and contracts for those functions.
For Example, the function
```racket
  ;double-radius: Number String -> Image
  (EXAMPLE (double-radius 10 "cyan")
    (circle (* 10 2) "solid" "cyan"))
```
